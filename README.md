### Key Features:
1. **Parametric Modeling**: Allows you to easily modify your design by going back into the model history and changing parameters.
2. **Modular Architecture**: FreeCAD is built with a modular architecture, allowing for extensions and custom tools.
3. **Sketcher**: A tool for creating 2D sketches that can be used as a base for 3D models.
4. **Part Design**: Tools for creating complex 3D parts from sketches.
5. **Assembly**: Modules for assembling different parts into a complete product (though this is still under development in some versions).
6. **Technical Drawing**: Generate 2D technical drawings from 3D models.
7. **Simulation**: Tools for finite element analysis (FEA) to test the strength and performance of designs.
8. **Path Workbench**: Create toolpaths for CNC machining.
9. **Rendering**: Basic rendering capabilities, with the ability to export to external renderers.
10. **Python Scripting**: Extensive scripting capabilities using Python for automation and custom tools.

### Use Cases:
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Design and analyze mechanical parts and assemblies.
- **Product Design**: Develop and visualize product designs.
- **Architecture**: Create architectural models and plans.
- **Electrical Engineering**: Design and layout electrical systems.
- **3D Printing**: Prepare models for 3D printing.

### System Requirements:
- **Operating System**: Windows 7/8/10, macOS 10.12 or later, Linux.
- **Processor**: 1.4 GHz or faster.
- **RAM**: 4 GB or more recommended.
- **Graphics Card**: OpenGL 2.0 compatible GPU with 1 GB RAM or more.
- **Storage**: 1 GB of available hard-disk space.

### Pricing:
- **FreeCAD**: Free and open-source, with no cost for the software itself.

### Learning Resources:
- **FreeCAD Documentation**: Comprehensive official documentation.
- **FreeCAD Forum**: Community forum for discussions, tips, and support.
- **YouTube Channels**: Numerous tutorials and courses available from both official and community sources.
- **Books and Online Courses**: Various resources available for learning FreeCAD in depth.

### Professional Use:
While FreeCAD is free, it is powerful enough for professional use, especially in fields like mechanical engineering and product design. Professionals often use it in conjunction with other tools and services to enhance their workflow. For example:
- **Rendering**: Export models to external renderers like Blender or LuxRender for high-quality visualizations.
- **Simulation**: Use external FEA tools for more advanced simulations if needed.
- **Asset Libraries**: Platforms like GrabCAD for sharing and downloading 3D models.

FreeCAD's flexibility and active community make it a viable alternative to commercial CAD software, especially for those who need powerful parametric modeling capabilities without the cost.
